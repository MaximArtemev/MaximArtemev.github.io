  Hi! My name's Max and I'm a deep learning engineer and/or researcher in the field of generative models and/or computer vision. My area of expertise is image-to-image GAN-based models, modern normalizing flows and visual transformers for various computer vision tasks.

  In all of my projects I'm using <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>PyTorch</mark>.

          As a part of the beautification team, I single-handedly worked on a hair recoloring tool for our users. My goal was to deliver a **fast** (less than half of a second) and **lightweight** (less than 4Mb) mobile application. 

          * Starting from long and productive data collection and annotation, data filtration, bias (gender, race, hair color, hair type) elimination, and, finally, research
          * I had a relatively big and heavy [UNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)-like generator model in a [StarGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01865)-like framework.
          * Next steps were distillation (hard) and quantization (easy) which deserves a separate inclusion to this page. At this point I had a small team of junior researchers of my own. We tried multiple approaches to GAN distillation ([1](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/5765), [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00159.pdf), [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03467), [4](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/KDGAN%3A-Knowledge-Distillation-with-Generative-Wang-Zhang/2a4f50cca273813da26ef25e5bda7d01b5e0dde6)) and decided to develop our own. As for the quantization, we used a simple static quantization from [Pytorch-beta](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/quantization.html)
          * Finally, we packed everything in <mark>ONNX</mark> and <mark>MNN</mark> models and called it a day.

          Just kidding, we continued to increase quality and latency of the model. The precice calculation of the user's hair mask was taken too much time, so we created a novel approach for our GAN to generate masks itself. This way we saved approximately 0.1-0.2 ms from inference time making it possible to use hair recoloring on video sequences.

          Another project for our beautification team. I mostly supervised it, but I think I should still state it here. 
          
          The goal was to create an algorithm that could photorealistically insert the hair from the reference image to the source image. The most interesting steps in the project pipeline are:
          * Facial keypoint detection and face alignment
          * Facial segmentation and hair alpha mask calculation
          * Statistical recoloring, alpha-blending
          * Inpainting

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
